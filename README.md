# List.h
Header file for the list ADT. Contains all of the necessary function prototypes and typedefs. Also keeps the object members separate for privacy.

# List.c
Contains the bodies of every function for the List ADT and the struct for the nodes to be utilized in the list.

# ListTest.c
File used for testing the functions during the creation of the List ADT. *Very unorganized, but contains every test I utilized while coding as comments*

# Lex.c
Main function of the project. Loads buffers from input file into an array, puts the indices of these items into the list (in lexicographic order), and prints the ordered list of strings into an output file.
